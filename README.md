STEGANOGRAPHY

Steganography is a way of hiding binary data inside an image.
In this case I used the last bit of every color on every pixel to do so, which means 3 bits of hidden data can be stored every pixel.


ALL TOGETHER

With this software you can encrypt a message and then hide it inside an image file.
You can later select the image and extract the hidden data from it. That data can be decoded with the enigma ecoder configured in the same way as the message was encoded in.
